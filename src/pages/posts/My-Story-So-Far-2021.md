It's difficult to know where to begin with this first post, presumably of many more to come. I recently joined a company in Brighton called Tillo as one of their new Junior Front-End Engineers, but like many on this path, my journey didn't start with an application or an interview, but quite a few years ago.

My story starts after 2012, going through a few dead end voluntary positions with charities and local businesses. I struggled to find any work, and had the fortnightly displeasure of visiting my local Job Centre in need of something more permanent.

For those who haven't had that misfortune, it's a place (at least in my personal experience) that pulls on the soul of anyone sensitive enough to understand that a great many people working there are under no moral obligation to help you. Being still somewhat young and naive, I had assumed that this building held unknown secrets that would lead me to a path of success in some role or other. Of course, I was wrong.

It's difficult to say when the change occurred, but one day my mind had enough. I broke down in tears in front of the poor lady who was signing my fortnightly papers, I had clearly lost all hope of finding anything that would sustain my life. I had always felt ashamed of being on benefits, especially knowing that my father had working tirelessly all his life, and for some reason I was failing.

Before this rather public episode of distress, I had unknowingly contracted Scabies, a rather dirty sound parasite, from another patron of this local Job Centre. A few years prior, I had the been publicly attacked twice, which made my willingness to even venture outside low; I was usually accompanied with my mother back and forth anywhere I went, which wasn't a great many places. This certainly had an affect on my willingness to continue, and had made me more anxious than ever, and up until this point, I was already becoming very anxious, with periodic, sometimes even daily panic attacks.

These events rendered me completed unable to do almost anything, especially anything that required social engagement. Even now, I still find socialising somewhat anxiety-inducing, but it's ever getting better.

And here is where a long, dark period of almost nothing occurring, happens. From 2012-2013 until 2021, I sat alone, unemployed, in my bedroom for the next near decade. I moved over from the Job Centre to Employment Support Allowance, and almost never ventured outside, not even into my garden. Life was passing by, family members moving out, friends moved abroad, and still I sat in my room. In that time, and it's hard to remember exactly when, I develop Coeliacs (Celiacs) Disease, making life ever harder, but I rarely complained about it.

Somewhere along this path I had decided to learn to code, primarily as a curiosity more than anything. My first project was small, and involved a simple script that would allow my mother and I to more easily log into our accounts. I learnt a small amount of VBAScript, Powershell and AutoIT.

After realising that I could in fact learn and code from the comfort of my bedroom. I started looking for every opportunity I had to code something. Keep in mind that most days then I felt particularly ill, so the hours were strange, often staying up late into the early hours, and waking after other were drifting into sleep. But I kept coding. To be honest, most of that decade I literally slept away.

Eventually I did a few small websites for communities I was a part of, and redesigned any site I came across that I felt needed a face-lift. I would contact the owner in question and offer freely my services, in exchange simply for my name to be placed at the footer of the site. Never did I receive a response, but my personal portfolio ever increased.

Approaching 2019 I had decided to focus on front end development. I loved the ubiquitousness of Javascript (despite hating earlier versions), and realised that this language could open many doors. I took a few courses on Udemy, specifically [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's course on Vue](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/), which helped a great deal with advancing my knowledge of not just Vue, but a greater understanding of front end development in general. Another solid recommendation is anything by [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/) as he helped me lay a solid foundation for everything to come after.

Every day, I would do my best to learn anything I could. I have several Raspberry Pi's running all sorts of Docker images, a full reverse proxy back-end with local DNS and full local HTTPS certification. Ansible, Python, Typescript; I would stick my fingers into as many programming pies as I could muster.

After 2018 I started to pick up speed, continuing to learn as best as I could, sometimes programming for 12 hours a day. I created [Forager](https://forager.crbroughton.me), which without, I wouldn't be currently employed. In early August, I started applying to jobs, honestly on a whim without any realistic goal of finding a job, but simply to see if anyone would reply. Tillo was most probably the first job I actually applied to that week, and was the only company to reply at all (a reply that wasn't a robot).

I say confidently say that weeks most pleasant surprise was not only a reply, but an invitation to an interview, something I had not done in over a decade. Naturally the interview process was done remotely, partially because of COVID restrictions, partly due to my own lack of confidence and abundance of anxiety.

Throughout that week, probably the longest week I can remember for a while, I received not just one invitation (I had previously assumed that the first interview would be my last; ever the pessimist from past experience) but 4. Interview after interview went well, and I (in my personal opinion) aced all the interviews as well as the technical, which was also a pleasant surprise.

I had begun to give up hope after a week went by without any sign of communication, when my now Line Manager reached out to me, asking for a call. That dreaded moment when you wonder to yourself what they might say, but never did I actually imagine that it would be an invitation to work at Tillo. As someone that has been unemployed for the better part of a decade, that day seemed like it would never come, and when it did, it didn't really seem real.

Now I've been at Tillo for a whole solid week, and I'm currently enjoying a well timed Bank Holiday weekend. I've completed a few tickets at work, and have a few more ready for me on Tuesday. My co-workers are all wonderful and we've all been getting along incredibly well, and I'm honestly looking forward to every day coming my way working with them. (One aspect of having a job is realising that my body over the years has been literally wasting away; I struggled to walk for the first week (and presumably the next) as I hadn't really walked properly in years. Just another thing I'll have to improve.)

This post is here for those who have that same internal self-doubt. I know there are so many of you out there that any position in programming seems a world away. Reality can hit you hard in the face, and I hope the above can show that if I can do it, you can too. Never give up hope, always strive to understand that which you don't, but most importantly, recognise that you have the capacity to learn anything. You can, and if you keep trying, you will make it.

I'll be posting more as I continue this journey of self-discovery, the troubles I face, what motivates me along the way, and how I progress and improve not just as a developer, but as a person in general. If you wish to join me on this journey, simply bookmark this blog, add it to your RSS feed, whatever way works best for you.

The next post here will be discussing my first week of work, what I expected and I what found along the way, my thoughts, trepidations and hopefully much more.

Finally, thank you for your limited time.
